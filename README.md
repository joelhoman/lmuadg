##2.0	Preliminary Project Proposal

lmuadg is a domain website that will be created for Alpha Delta Gamma Lambda Chapter at Loyola Marymount University.  The website will serve to keep students, faculty, alumni, and brothers from other chapters up to date on the current operations of the chapter, describe what the chapter values and stands for, and allow users to send a donation to the chapter.  Since the site will need to be updated on a semi-annual basis, there must be easy to use tools in place for others to edit the site who do not have any web design or programming experience.  In addition to the website, an editing tool specific to the site will be created to easily allow the site to be updated.

The proposed project will require knowledge from the clear majority of my classes at LMU, however, the most notable will be Interaction Design, Databases, and the experience gained from my 401 project.  While I do have experience designing web interfaces, the editing tool will require more careful attention to interaction design principles as its target audience will have no assumed experience with programming, web design, or even training with the tool as many web-editing interfaces will require.  All editable elements in the tool will need to be loaded and editable from a database for this to be possible, so concepts learned in Databases will be utilized.  I will be using many, but not all the same technologies used for my 401 project, so my experience working on that project will help boost my efficiency.  Additionally, my experience with agile development and documentation from my 401 project will help me manage my time and resources effectively.  

As far as the project timeline goes, a general website layout with all features functional should be done by week 6-7 of the semester.  While the website will require a few complicated API calls, it is a relatively straight-forward site.  However, the site will constantly be revisited throughout the semester by both myself and the customer for the project, who is the current chapter president of Alpha Delta Gamma at LMU.  This will primarily be to perfect the page layout, content, and interaction as the functionalities of the site have been agreed upon.  There may be a few additions to the functionality of the site, but no major changes are expected.

While the site will only pose minor challenge and a lot of time commitment, the editing tool will be the primary challenge of the project.  From a technical perspective, I will need to use an SQL database, which I do not currently have experience with, to edit all text and image content on the site.  There will be a learning curve for me to adapt to a new technology here, so I have given myself 3-4 weeks to have the database functional with the ability to modify the contents of the database and the content of the site.

The remainder of the time will be spent refining the editing tool and making it as easy to use as possible.  I currently have a website preview interface set as a stretch goal, which essentially will mean the tool will take on the appearance of the current site, and new content can be typed or drag and dropped onto the preview to update the database, giving the user a snapshot of what the site will look like before submitting it to the live version.
I feel based on experience with my 401 project that this project is both of appropriate difficulty, but is also a more manageable project.  Currently my MVP encompasses all the goals of my customer, other than the preview in the editing tool, which is a personal stretch goal that would make the tool much more user friendly.  I also have a strong interest in completing this project, as I have served as an active for the past 3 years and was the past chapter president.  While I have been active, we have never had a website for our chapter, while many of the other Greek organizations on our campus do.  This will also greatly help us maintain contact with the school, our alumni from our chapter, and our other chapters nationwide.

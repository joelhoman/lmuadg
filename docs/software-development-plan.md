##4.0	Software Development Plan

###4.1	Plan Introduction

This Software Development Plan provides the details of the planned development for the domain site lmuadg.com, the domain site for Alpha Delta Gamma Lambda Chapter at Loyola Marymount University, as well as the accompanying webapp responsible for the maintenance of the site.

On the site users will be able to learn about the chapter and a bit about its history, view a current chapter newsletter detailing current chapter operations, meet the current executive board of the chapter, view a live feed of our social media accounts, including Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter, and send a donation to the chapter via PayPal.  All text and images on the site will be loaded through MongoDB for the purposes of maintenance.  The accompanying webapp, which will be accessible only to myself and select representatives from the chapter, will be responsible for editing the documents in MongoDB in order to keep information on the site correct and up-to-date.
